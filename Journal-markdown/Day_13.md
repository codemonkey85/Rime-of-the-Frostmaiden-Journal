# Day 13

- Made it to Dougan’s Hole, look for wolves outside of town
- Korin Kanan (talking wolf)
- Hurt by its master Gurgeye
- Followed for 90 minutes
- Towering edifice of ice, 3 x the height / width of any building in Ten Towns
- Giant mammoth, wolves turned on us
- Beat them all, found some dead teens, yikes
- Brought the kiddos back to town
- Look for a Druid nearby now?
- Communed with the dead (mammoth head), asked some questions:
- Ice giant was Gurgeye, mammoth and wolves’ master, an ice giant druid who served Auril
