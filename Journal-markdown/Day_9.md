# Day 9

- Heading to the cabin
- Checking out an inn we might buy
- Fought gremlin thingies
- Went to cabin, found shiny thing
- Shiny thing exploded everyone but me, ‘tha balls’ died
- Just kidding, they’re in another plane
- Talked to ‘dead’ friends, fixed shiny thing, turns out it’s a weather device
- Brought friends back, crazy guy who invented weather thing peaced out
- We turned up the temp, Aurel’s minions found us, wuh oh
- Big fight but we’re awesome
- Two cold light walkers and three meffits
