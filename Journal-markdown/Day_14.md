# Day 14

- Crafting time for Balrash, it’s gross (because it’s Balrash amirite)
- He made a nifty shield from the mammoth skull! Sick.
- Balrum’s throughts:
- “Id Ascendant”
- “Mind Flayer Ship”
- “Balrum has Mind Flayer eggs in him?”
- I talked to the Nautiloid, they are gnomes I guess
- 10 gold to Balrum if they are in fact mind flayers
- Found the ship
- Monsters!
- We beat them, also Arn is a new player
- We enter the ship
- Gross creatures, some stitched together
- “Flesh Golem” fight
- “Gnome” shows up and stops the flesh golem
- He is a “ceramorph”
- Traded my psi crystal for a light gun
- Now I’m depressed (‘Flowers for Algernon’)
- Fought a monster
- Made it to Good Meade for a long rest
