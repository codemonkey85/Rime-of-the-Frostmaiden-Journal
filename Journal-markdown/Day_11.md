# Day 11

- Talking whale next!
- Long rest in final ice hut thingy
- Morning comes, day 2 of rations
- Bird attack!
- I easily killed one
- Found dock, cabin, dock, talking whale with a boat
- “Are we trying to roofie a whale?”
- Prove our worth to the whale
- On our way back to town, trap!
- OH SHIT IT’S THE DRAGON
- Nearly died, it’s cool though
- We bravely turned our tails and fled
- Level up! Level 5
- Found a big old giant circle of thrones
- Long rest
- Giant ghost appeared and put us into a gauntlet arena
- We fought a frost giant and some wispy dudes, beat them of course
- Down the weird stairs under the throne we go
