# Day 12

- The inscription carved into the arch above the a poem written in the Dwarvish alphabet:
  - Snatch a scale from a sleeping wyrm;
  - Against the blowing wind, stand firm.
  - Climb a mountain with a stone in your shoe
  - On little feet, death comes for you.
  - Be the arrow that starts the war;
  - Let life's blood fall till it falls no more.
- We lit the death one!
- Nevermind, we lit them all easily
- Animated axes attack!
- Found a horn of blasting
- Frost giant fight!
- A walrus, two elk and a goat
- Goat was a druid! We killed them all
- Back to Bremen, slept overnight in the cold
- Talked to some folks about the lake creature, gonna get a boat from Jorge
- Got a boat, talked to the obnoxious lake creature, said goodbye for nowâ€¦ until the next full moon
- Back to Bremen, got a scroll of animal friendship
- Next stop: Good Mead and our manor
